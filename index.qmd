# Introduction {#sec-intro}

The opening chapter of a thesis or dissertation will typically provide an
introduction to the body of research. At the beginning of a chapter, it is
common to provide some introductory text. Instead of discussing research, this
template document will highlight how the `byuthesis` class and
\LaTeX{} can be used to prepare a thesis or dissertation document for submission
in the College of Engineering at BYU. A concise statement of the College of
Engineering formatting requirements can be found in @sec-reqs.
