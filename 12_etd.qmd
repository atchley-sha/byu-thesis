# Electronic Document Submission {#app-etd}

The university requires all dissertations and theses to be submitted
electronically as a PDF document. All required fonts should be embedded in the
PDF document to ensure that your document will appear as intended wherever it is
viewed. You can verify that all fonts are appropriately embedded by opening your
PDF document in Adobe Acrobat Reader and selecting
`File->Properties`. Under the Font tab, you should see a list of the
fonts used in your document. To ensure that all fonts are embedded, they should
be designated as "Embedded" or "Embedded Subset" in the list.

## PDF Bookmarks
The PDF document must contain bookmarks for preliminary pages plus chapter
headings and subheadings, as listed in the Table of Contents. In the PDF
document, bookmarks should be displayed in a panel to the left of the document
pages as seen in @fig-pdfbooks.

If assistance is needed with embedding, bookmarks, or other aspects of
submitting the ETD, you may obtain assistance at the Multimedia Lab in the HBLL.
Please note that keywords for your research will be required at the time you
submit your document. Keywords must be in lower case, unless they are acronyms
or proper nouns. In addition, a copy of the abstract must be inserted. Helpful
information on submitting your ETD copy can be found at
